/*
If your environment support tree-shaking you can also import the icons this way:

    import { AccessAlarm, ThreeDRotation } from '@material-ui/icons';

Note: Importing named exports in this way will result in the code for every icon being included in your project,
so is not recommended unless you configure tree-shaking. It may also impact Hot Module Reload performance.
